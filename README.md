## 🎯 Overview

This project implements an intelligent AI agent for **Trail Isolation**, a strategic board game variant where two players compete to isolate their opponent. The AI uses sophisticated adversarial search algorithms to make optimal moves, achieving high win rates against various baseline opponents.

## 🎮 Game Rules

**Trail Isolation** is played on an N×N grid with these key rules:

- **Players**: Two players each control a queen
- **Movement**: Queens move like chess queens (any number of squares horizontally, vertically, or diagonally)
- **Blocking**:

  - Starting square becomes permanently blocked after moving

  - Path squares (trail) become temporarily blocked for opponent's next turn only

- **Objective**: Force opponent into a position with no legal moves
- **Loss Condition**: Player with no legal moves loses immediately

### Basic Test Game
```python
from isolation import Board
from test_players import RandomPlayer
from submission import CustomPlayer

# Initialize players
ai_player = CustomPlayer(search_depth=3)
random_player = RandomPlayer()

# Create and play game
game = Board(ai_player, random_player)
winner, history, reason = game.play_isolation(time_limit=5000)

print(f"🏆 Winner: {winner}")
print(f"📝 Reason: {reason}")
```

## 📚 Technical Documentation

### Core Components

#### CustomPlayer Class
The main AI agent with intelligent move selection:

```python
class CustomPlayer:
    def __init__(self, search_depth=3, eval_fn=CustomEvalFn()):
        self.search_depth = search_depth
        self.eval_fn = eval_fn
    
    def move(self, game, time_left):
        # Implements iterative deepening with alpha-beta pruning
        # Returns optimal move within time constraints
```

#### Search Algorithms

**Minimax**
```python
def minimax(player, game, time_left, depth, my_turn=True):
    # Recursive minimax implementation
    # Returns (best_move, utility_value)
```

**Alpha-Beta Pruning**
```python
def alphabeta(player, game, time_left, depth, alpha=-inf, beta=inf, my_turn=True):
    # Optimized minimax with pruning
    # Reduces search space significantly
```

#### Evaluation Functions

**Basic Evaluation**
```python
class OpenMoveEvalFn:
    def score(self, game, my_player):
        my_moves = len(game.get_player_moves(my_player))
        opp_moves = len(game.get_opponent_moves(my_player))
        return my_moves - opp_moves
```

**Advanced Evaluation**
```python
class CustomEvalFn:
    def score(self, game, my_player):
        # Combines mobility, center control, and aggression
        # Includes terminal state detection
```

### Algorithm Details

#### Iterative Deepening Strategy
- Starts with depth 1, incrementally increases
- Uses time limits to ensure timely responses
- Always returns best move found so far
- 50ms safety buffer prevents timeout

#### Alpha-Beta Optimization
- Prunes unpromising branches early
- Maintains optimal move selection
- Significantly reduces computation time

#### Evaluation Heuristics
1. **Mobility**: Difference in available moves
2. **Center Control**: Bonus for central positioning
3. **Aggression**: Rewards restricting opponent mobility
4. **Terminal States**: Immediate win/loss detection

## 💻 Usage Examples

### Basic Game Setup
```python
from isolation import Board
from test_players import RandomPlayer, HumanPlayer
from submission import CustomPlayer

# AI vs Random
ai_player = CustomPlayer(search_depth=4)
random_player = RandomPlayer()
game = Board(ai_player, random_player)
```

### Custom Configuration
```python
# Advanced AI with custom evaluation
from submission import CustomPlayer, CustomEvalFn

advanced_ai = CustomPlayer(
    search_depth=5,
    eval_fn=CustomEvalFn()
)
```

### Interactive Game
```python
# Human vs AI (in Jupyter)
from board_viz import InteractiveGame
from submission import CustomPlayer

ig = InteractiveGame(CustomPlayer(), show_legal_moves=True)
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Local Test Suite
```python
import player_submission_tests as tests
from submission import CustomPlayer, OpenMoveEvalFn

# Run comprehensive tests
tests.correctOpenEvalFn(OpenMoveEvalFn)
tests.beatRandom(CustomPlayer)
tests.minimaxTest(CustomPlayer, minimax)
```

### Performance Testing
```bash
# Test against different opponents
python -c "
from submission import CustomPlayer
from test_players import RandomPlayer
from isolation import Board

# Run multiple games for statistics
wins = 0
for i in range(10):
    game = Board(CustomPlayer(), RandomPlayer())
    winner, _, _ = game.play_isolation()
    if 'CustomPlayer' in winner:
        wins += 1
print(f'Win rate: {wins/10:.1%}')
"
```

## 📊 Performance

## 🔧 Development

### Adding New Features

1. **New Evaluation Function**
```python
class AdvancedEvalFn:
    def score(self, game, my_player):
        # Implement your heuristic here
        return strategic_score
```

2. **Custom Search Algorithm**

    # Implement alternative search strategy
    return best_move, best_value
```

### Debugging Tips

1. **Use Visualization**

from board_viz import ReplayGame
# Visualize game history for analysis
```

2. **Profile Performance**
```python
import cProfile

3. **Test Edge Cases**
```python
# Test specific board states
test_board.set_state(custom_state, p1_turn=True)
